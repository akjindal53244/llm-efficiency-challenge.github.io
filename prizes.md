 For each of the two hardware categories, we will select winning groups for the top three positions: 1st place, 2nd place, and 3rd place.</p>

- The first place winning group will receive a \$7,500 cash prize,
- The second  place group will receive \$5,000, and
- The third place group will receive \$1,000.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Additionally, we will present two student awards per hardware category, granted to the highest-ranking groups outside the top 3 positions and composed entirely of matriculating students in a university or graduate program. Each student award recipient group will receive \$500 and the best student submission will receive an extra \$2,500. Winners will be announced on the competition website as well as during the in-person workshop at NeurIPS.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>The two first place winning teams will be invited to give a 30-minute presentation each during the in-person workshop at NeurIPS, and all members of those teams will be offered a chance to co-author the report-out paper on this competition.</p>
