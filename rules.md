# Rules

The rules of this competition aim to ensure fair evaluation and reproducible results. To this end, we require the following:


* <p style='text-align: justify;'>Submissions must be reproducible from initial model through fine tuning and inference. Winning models, along with all associated code and data, must be open-sourced and made public after the competition under the MIT or Apache 2 license.
* <p style='text-align: justify;'>Submissions must NOT use any copyrighted or proprietary data, code, or closed-source content. The use of data or content that breaks service contracts or trade secrets of any entity is not allowed.
* <p style='text-align: justify;'>Teams are encouraged to use any open-source code and libraries, provided they give proper attribution.
* <p style='text-align: justify;'>Submissions must take less than 24 hours to fine-tune on a single Nvidia A100 or Nvidia 4090 graphics card.
* <p style='text-align: justify;'>A team can have no more than five members. Teams must self-certify that no individual in the team is participating in other teams for this competition.
* <p style='text-align: justify;'>Teams can submit to either or both Nvidia A100 and Nvidia 4090 hardware tracks.
* <p style='text-align: justify;'>Each team can make three submissions to each track during the competition. The best-performing model will be used to rank the team on the leaderboard and selected for final model evaluation.
* <p style='text-align: justify;'>Teams with one or more members working as full-time employees (FTEs) at Meta or Microsoft are also welcome to participate. Their submissions will be ranked but will not be eligible for cash prizes.
* <p style='text-align: justify;'>Organizers and advisors associated with the competition are not allowed to participate.
* <p style='text-align: justify;'>This competition will be run under the honor system. Teams that submit very similar results or copy another team's solution will be disqualified. Violating the spirit of the honor system or taking unfair advantage of the community, even when not against an explicit rule, may result in disqualification and ineligibility for prizes.
