## Submission

<p style='text-align: justify;'>A starting-kit can be found here: 
[https://github.com/msaroufim/singlegpu/](https://github.com/msaroufim/singlegpu/blob/main/README.md)</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>This github page contains code to download a pre-trained model and submit a fine-tuned model as PyTorch weights and interface with our evaluation system. We will soon publish a detailed  tutorial on how to take a base model, fine-tune on a single GPU and run the evaluations.</p>
