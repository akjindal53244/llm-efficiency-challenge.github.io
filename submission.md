## Starter kit

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
A starter kit with an end-to-end submission flow can be found here:

[https://github.com/llm-efficiency-challenge/neurips_llm_efficiency_challenge](https://github.com/llm-efficiency-challenge/neurips_llm_efficiency_challenge)</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>We may make modifications to our submission and evaluation pipeline, but the evaluation metrics will remain stable and unchanged. If any of your previously submitted content encounters issues due to these changes, we will reach out and work with you to address it.
